## 📌 Project Overview

Soul Foods wanted to answer one key business question:

> *"Were sales higher before or after the Pink Morsel price increase on 15th January 2021?"*

This project processes raw transaction data and visualises it through an interactive Dash web application — making the answer immediately obvious.

## 📊 Key Insight

The line chart clearly shows that **sales were higher before the price increase** on January 15, 2021. After the price increase from **$2.99 → $3.99**, daily Pink Morsel sales dropped noticeably — giving Soul Foods a clear, data-backed answer.
